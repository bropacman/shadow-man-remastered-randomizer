# Shadow Man Remastered Randomizer

A standalone randomizer for **Shadow Man Remastered** (Nightdive Studios, 2021).
Randomizes key items, souls, weapons, gad powers, soul gate thresholds, enemies,
music, and SFX using a custom assumed-fill algorithm that guarantees every seed
is beatable.

---

## Features

### What Gets Randomized
- **Progression items** — Engineers Key, Poigne, Baton, Flambeau, Marteau, Calabash,
  Eclipser parts, Retractors, Accumulators, Flashlight, Prison Key Card
- **Gad powers** — Touch, Walk, and Swim Gad as physical pickups shuffled across
  temple locations (requires `--shuffle-gad-temples`, EXE patch applied automatically)
- **Weapons** — Asson, Shotgun, Enseigne, MP5, Tête de Mort, Desert Eagle
- **Lore items** — Book of Shadows, Prophecy, Jack's Schematic
- **Dark Souls and Govis** — shuffled across all soul slots
- **Soul gate SL requirements** — coffin gate thresholds reshuffled across deadside
  (in-world ARC ring decorations updated to match)
- **Enemies** — enemy types shuffled with three modes: depth-weighted by tier
  (default), purely random by movement type, or themed by context group
- **Music** — track-to-track global shuffle (optional)
- **SFX** — Shadow Man voice lines and weapon sounds (optional)

### Logic Guarantees
- Assumed-fill algorithm guarantees all seeds are beatable before patching
- Soul gate shuffle ensures starting gates (Wasteland, Asylum, Path 3) stay at SL≤3
- Eclipser lock group prevents circular placement
- Liveside souls correctly require NIGHT (all three Eclipsers) to collect
- Full sphere-by-sphere playthrough simulation written to spoiler log

### Delivery
- Patches are packed into a single `shadowman_randomizer.kpf` mod file
- Installed to the game's `mods/` folder — no original files are modified
- Delete the KPF (or run `--restore`) to instantly return to vanilla

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Shadow Man Remastered (Steam or GOG)
- PyYAML (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

---

## Quick Start

### Just want to play?

Download **`Shadow Man Randomizer.exe`** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jonathanmanos/shadow-man-remastered-randomizer/releases/latest).
No Python required — double-click and go.

### Running from source

Clone the repo and install the one dependency:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanmanos/shadow-man-remastered-randomizer.git
cd shadow-man-remastered-randomizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**GUI** (recommended): double-click **`Launch Randomizer.bat`** — opens the interface, no terminal needed.

**CLI**: run the patcher directly:

```bash
python patcher.py --game-dir "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Shadow Man Remastered"
```

### Building the exe yourself

```bash
build.bat
```

Produces `dist/Shadow Man Randomizer.exe`. Requires Python + PyInstaller (the script installs them automatically).

---

The patcher writes a spoiler log next to itself (`spoiler_seed_<N>.txt`).
Drop the generated `shadowman_randomizer.kpf` in the game's `mods/` folder and play.

### Common recipes

```bash
# Reproduce a specific seed
python patcher.py --game-dir <PATH> --seed 12345

# Add gad temple shuffle (EXE patch applied automatically)
python patcher.py --game-dir <PATH> --shuffle-gad-temples

# Shuffle enemies with the difficulty-weighted default
python patcher.py --game-dir <PATH> --shuffle-enemies

# Themed enemy shuffle (deadside / liveside / prison stay separated)
python patcher.py --game-dir <PATH> --shuffle-enemies --enemy-mode contextual

# Easy preset: most gates open, max SL capped at 8
python patcher.py --game-dir <PATH> --gate-preset easy

# Throw everything in the blender
python patcher.py --game-dir <PATH> \
    --shuffle-gad-temples --shuffle-enemies --shuffle-true-forms \
    --shuffle-music --shuffle-voices --shuffle-weapons-sfx

# Restore vanilla
python patcher.py --restore --game-dir <PATH>
```

## How the Patcher Works

1. **Extract** — pulls quest/instance/fx/resource/enemies RSC files from KPF archives
2. **Inject** — adds `RSC_X_GAD_PICKUP` records to temple files (if gad shuffle enabled)
3. **Parse** — reads all RSC records from extracted files
4. **Fill** — runs assumed-fill to place progression items logically
5. **Gate shuffle** — writes new SL thresholds to `links.e2o` files
6. **Patch RSC** — writes new item names to all RSC files
7. **Patch enemies** — shuffles enemy type names in enemies RSC files (if enabled)
8. **Patch EXE** — writes prison key card position fix (always) + gad pickup dispatch (if enabled)
9. **Update decos** — renames ARC coffin gate decorations to match new SL values
10. **Repack** — packs all modified files into `shadowman_randomizer.kpf`

---

## Location Data

All randomizable locations are defined in `data/locations.csv`. Each row defines:
- Where the item physically lives (`level_id`, `source_file`, `offset`)
- What item is there in vanilla (`object`, `category`)
- What logic gates access to it (`level_region`, `sub_region`)

To add or edit locations, modify the CSV then run:
```bash
python tools/generate.py
```

Enemy locations follow the same pattern in `data/enemy_locations.csv` with
additional `context_group` and `movement_type` columns for shuffle pooling.
To regenerate after edits:
```bash
python tools/generate_enemies.py
```

## Soul Gate Thresholds

Soul gates use a non-linear threshold scale:

| SL | Souls Required |
|----|---------------|
| 0  | 0 |
| 1  | 1 |
| 2  | 3 |
| 3  | 7 |
| 4  | 15 |
| 5  | 23 |
| 6  | 35 |
| 7  | 51 |
| 8  | 71 |
| 9  | 95 |
| 10 | 120 (locked) |

Gates SL0 (Marrow), SL10 (Mystery), and Fogometers Interior are always locked
at their vanilla values. All other gates are freely shuffled with the constraint
that the three starting gates (Wasteland, Asylum, Path 3) never exceed SL3.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Game directory not found" / wrong files patched.** Pass the install folder
explicitly with `--game-dir`. The default assumes the script is sitting next to
the game folder; if you cloned somewhere else, that won't be true.

**Game still loads vanilla.** The patcher writes to `mods/shadowman_randomizer.kpf`.
Confirm the file is there and that no other mods are overriding the same RSC files.

**Run failed mid-patch.** A `_randomizer_work_<seed>` folder is left next to the
game so you can inspect it. Safe to delete. Re-run the patcher to start clean.

**Want vanilla back fast.** `python patcher.py --restore --game-dir <PATH>` or
just delete `mods/shadowman_randomizer.kpf`.

## Known Limitations

- Ambient enemy shuffle (flies, rats, egrets etc.) is catalogued and categorised
  but disabled pending stability testing

## Contributing

Bug reports, seed pathology cases, and PRs welcome. When filing an issue, please
include the seed, the exact CLI flags you used, and the spoiler log if the run
completed.
